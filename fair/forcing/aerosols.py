    This function is just an emulator - a full implementation in Python of the
    Ghan routine (originally coded in Fortran) exists, but will require
    optimisation before it can be used in FAIR. I hope to make the full version
    available in a future version.

    A 100-member Latin Hypercube sample of emissions of SOx, NMVOC, BC and OC
    was prepared offline and run through the Ghan simple model. A radial basis
    function interpolator then estimates the radiative forcing based on the 
    sampled points.

    A word of caution: this function may be unreliable outside of the points
    on which it has been trained - generally anything greater than about 5x
    present day emissions (of course there is no guarantee that the underlying
    model will perform well in such high emission scenarios, either) - but may
    also struggle for other parameter combinations as it has not been
    extensively tested. Use common sense at all times!
